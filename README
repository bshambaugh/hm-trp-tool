To compile a simple test-tool that reads current configuration from a device,
and nothing more, run build-read-tool.sh. This is a shell-script, not a 
Makefile, simply because QT qmake will overwrite any Makefile in the directory.

To build the QT GUI tool, use your installed QT to do:

  qmake Configurator.pro && make

This code is, as far as QT licensing permits, public domain code.
